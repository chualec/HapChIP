Software Requirement Specification
For: hichip
by: Alec

1. Introduction
This is a tool to process raw hichip data from fastq files. The core of the tool will be to:
	a. perform rudimentary quality control including
		i. percentage of high quality reads mapping uniquly
		ii. percent of trans-chromosome reads
		iii. 
	b. identify locations where hichip reads are significantly bounded
	c. Create rudimentary map of connected spaces
	d. perform plotting of quality control

2. Overall description
Input: Paired fastq files for HiChIP samples.
Output: paired information files for the HiChIP.
Method: 

3. Requirements
Packages: Conda environment, snakemake tools.
Input data format: This should be in fastq files without pre-processing.
