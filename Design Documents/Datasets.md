Datasets that will be required for the tool:
  - HiChIP data
    - This may be in the form of FASTQ files or Bam files. Pre-processing for either will not be required.
    - Alternatively, HiC and other chromatin capture sequences may be used, but will result in lower quality results.
    - A down-sampled small FASTQ of HiChIP data will be provided for unit testing purposes
      - This is in-house generated, de-identified CTCF HiChIP
  - Reference genome for alignment. We suggest downloading the latest reference genome from UCS
